Repository for Assignment 1 of COMP140-GAM160

# Game concept:
An 8-bit 2D sidescroller set in the 1980’s. The protagonist is a (rogue?) policeman in a frantic search to arrest or kill the leader of a dangerous drug gang. After the officer arrests too many of the antagonist’s best men the gang leader goes after the one thing the policeman treasures most, his family. The gameplay consists of the player clearing each level by eliminating or arresting each criminal along the path of his search for the gang leader. 

# Core game mechanic:
-Activate special objects/pieces of evidence to reenact a crime to uncover some of the storyline to the player.
-Activate a special ability to improved accuracy and damage. 

# Controller concept:
The controller will very much be following the style of the art style I wish to follow, this means the controller will be very retro but doesn't mean it will lack in comfort for the user. Taking inspiration from the 1990 SNES console controller which contains very few buttons for the user to get comfortable using after a few minutes of use with the hardware itself. Due to the game being on a 2D landscape, it has no need for analogue sticks whatsoever. However, I will most probably make use of a directional pad, a start button as well as a button for the user to press to fire within the game. The directional pad will be located on the left-hand of the controller, the start button will be located within the middle of the controller finally, the fire button will be located at the right-hand side of the controller.
