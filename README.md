# Game concept:
An 8-bit 2D sidescroller set in the 1980’s. The protagonist is a (rogue?) policeman in a frantic search to arrest or kill the leader of a dangerous drug gang. After the officer arrests too many of the antagonist’s best men the gang leader goes after the one thing the policeman treasures most, his family. The gameplay consists of the player clearing each level by eliminating or arresting each criminal along the path of his search for the gang leader. 

# Core game mechanic:
•	Activate special objects/pieces of evidence to reenact a crime to uncover some of the storyline to the player.
•	Activate a special ability to improved accuracy and damage.
